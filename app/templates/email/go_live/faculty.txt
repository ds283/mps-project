Dear {{ user.first_name }}

This is an automated email from the Sussex Physics & Astronomy
project management web app at https://mpsprojects.co.uk.

You are receiving this email because you are enrolled as a supervisor for
projects of type "{{ pclass.name }}". If you believe this to be
incorrect, please contact the project convenor to have your enrollment
status changed.

Thank you for preparing your project library for {{ pclass.name }}.
The projects for this cycle have now been published to students, so any
further changes made to your library will not be visible to selectors.

{% if number_projects == 0 -%}
This year, no projects belonging to you were published. If this is not the
outcome you were expecting then please contact the convenor as soon as
possible.
{%- else -%}
The following projects have now been published on the live platform:
{% for p in projects -%}
- {{ p.name }}
  https://mpsprojects.co.uk/faculty/live_project/{{ p.id }}
{% endfor -%}
Follow the links to see how each project will appear to student selectors.
{%- endif %}

{% if not expect_requests -%}
None of your projects require students to obtain a sign-off before inclusion
in their ranked list of preferences. Therefore you may not receive any
further emails until student selection is closed, but you can monitor
the popularity of your projects and the number of students that have
bookmarked or selected each one.
{%- else -%}
One or more of your projects requires students to obtain a sign-off before
inclusion in their ranked list of preferences. This allows you to screen
students where appropriate to ensure they have sufficient preparation,
but we ask you to provide the sign-off if at all possible.  You will be
notified by email when students request confirmation. You can select the
frequency with which to receive emails from the Settings option available
from your account drop-down menu.

In addition, you can use your dashboard to monitor the popularity of your
projects and the number of students that have bookmarked or selected each one.
You can also manage student confirmations from the dashboard.

Thank you for your help,
