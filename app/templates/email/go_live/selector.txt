You are receiving this email because you have the option to apply or enroll
as a participant for "{{ pclass.name }}". If you are unsure whether you
are eligible for "{{ pclass.name }}", please seek guidance from the
project convenor whose details are given below.

If this is not relevant for you, then you need take no action and can safely
ignore the remainder of this email.
{%- else -%}
You are receiving this email because we are expecting you to participate in
the "{{ pclass.name }}" module. This runs in Y{{ pclass.start_year }}, and it is now
time to select your preferred projects. If you believe this to be incorrect,
for example if you are not expecting to undertake this type of project, please
contact the convenor as soon as possible. Contact details are given below.

This year's project list has now been published, and can be inspected
by logging in to our web platform: https://mpsprojects.sussex.ac.uk.

If you have used the platform before, log in with your Sussex email
address and existing password. If not, an account has been set up for you
using your Sussex email address and a random password that is not known to
anyone. Use the 'Forgot password?' link to reset your password, and then
log into the website in the usual way. If you experience log-in
difficulties then please contact David Seery (D.Seery@sussex.ac.uk).

To view the project list, log in to your account and scroll to find the
box labelled "{{ pclass.name }}" on your dashboard.
Now click the green button labelled "Show available projects".
You can search the list by entering keywords or phrases in the
search box in the top-right, or by applying filters for keywords
and affiliations/research groups in the box labelled "Filters".

Each project has a description, and a number of key facts that detail
recommended modules, supervision arrangements and subject information.
If you have not taken the recommended modules then you can still apply
for the project, but you should make arrangements to discuss with the
supervisor beforehand. Some project descriptions may include popularity
indicators. You can use these to get some sense of how many other students
are interested in a project, and therefore whether it is likely to be
oversubscribed. The popularity indicators may not be available until enough
data has been collected.

Use the "bookmark" function to keep track of projects in which you
are interested. Bookmarked projects appear on your dashboard for quick
access, and you can drag-and-drop individual bookmarks to arrange
them in order of preference. Once you have bookmarked enough projects
you can submit your ranked list. You can do this as many times as you
like before the selection deadline. We are asking you to select
at least {{ student.number_choices }} projects to help us find a good match for everyone.
{% if student.is_optional -%}

The deadline for selections is {{ deadline.strftime("%a %d %b %Y") }}.
You do not need to do anything else to apply for enrolment in the programme.
If you do not submit a selection by the deadline we will assume that you
do not wish to apply.
{%- else -%}
The deadline for selections is {{ deadline.strftime("%a %d %b %Y") }}.
{%- endif %}

Some projects require more background than others. In these cases the
project supervisor may require you to obtain a signoff before
allowing you to submit a selection containing the project. To request
a sign-off, use the 'Request confirmation' button. You will be notified by
email when the supervisor responds. Use the "Settings..." option
from the drop-down menu at the top of the page to control how often
the website contacts you by email.

If you have questions or encounter difficulties, please contact the
project convenor.
