You are receiving this email because we believe you are eligible to apply for
a Sussex Junior Research Associate award for summer 2023. If you do not wish
to apply, then you need take no action and can safely ignore this email.

The list of projects has now been published, and can be inspected by logging
in to our web platform:

https://mpsprojects.sussex.ac.uk

Please note that the list is intended as a basis for discussion with
prospective supervisors. You are not limited to proposing projects on the
list, although they do give you an idea of the subject areas each faculty
member is prepared to supervise.

If a faculty member does not appear on the list, this is an indication
that they are not actively looking to recruit a JRA student this year,
but should *not* be taken to mean definitively that they will not be willing
to supervise you. You should feel free to contact individual faculty members
to check their availability.

If you have used the platform before, log in with your Sussex email
address and existing password. If not, an account has been set up for you
using your Sussex email address and a random password that is not known to
anyone. Use the 'Forgot password?' link to reset your password, and then
log into the website in the usual way. If you experience log-in
difficulties then please contact David Seery (D.Seery@sussex.ac.uk).

To view the project list, log in to your account and scroll to find the
box labelled "{{ pclass.name }}" on your dashboard.
Now click the green button labelled "Show available projects".
You can search the list by entering keywords or phrases in the
search box in the top-right, or by applying filters for keywords
and research groups in the box labelled "Filters".

Each project has a description, and a number of key facts that detail
recommended modules, supervision arrangements and subject information.
If you have not taken the recommended modules then you can still apply
for the project, but you should make arrangements to discuss with the
supervisor beforehand. Some project descriptions may include popularity
indicators. You can use these to get some sense of how many other students
are interested in a project, and therefore whether it is likely to be
oversubscribed. The popularity indicators may not be available until enough
data has been collected.

For JRA projects, you need to apply separately through the Sussex Undergradute
Research OfficeL

There is no need to submit a ranked list of projects on the
mpsprojects.sussex.ac.uk website; the project list there is purely for
information only. Please note that you need to make contact with a prospective
supervisor before submitting an application. You are advised to do this as
early as possible, because putting together a compelling JRA application can
take some time.

If you have questions or encounter difficulties, please contact David Seery
(D.Seery@sussex.ac.uk) who acts as an unofficial contact for the JRA scheme
within Physics & Astronomy.

The MPS JRA team.
