Unattached assets report for {{ date }}

This refers specifically to submitted (or uploaded) assets. Specifically,
"unattached" here means that an asset record is present in the database,
but it is not linked to a submission record or period configuration.

{% for asset in assets -%}
{%- set type = asset['type'] -%}
{%- set id = asset['id'] -%)
{%- set name = asset['name'] -%}
{{ loop.index }} {{ type }} #{{ id }}. {{ name }}
{% endfor %}
