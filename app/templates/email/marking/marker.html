<p>Dear {{ marker.user.first_name }}</p>

<p><strong>This email is automated. Please do not reply to it directly, because email to the sending address is not monitored.</strong></p>

<p>You have been assigned as second marker for a {{ pclass.abbreviation }} student (candidate number {{ student.exam_number }}).</p>

<p>Title: {{ project.name }}
<br>Supervisor: {{ supervisor.user.name }} <{{ supervisor.user.email }}></p>

{% if project.aims and project.aims|length > 0 -%}
<p>The supervisor has given the following statement of aims, which you may wish to bear in mind when forming your opinion of the report.</p>

<p><strong>AIMS:</strong>
<br>{{ project.aims }}</p>
{% endif -%}

{% if project.review_only -%}
<p>Please be aware that the project supervisor has marked this project as "review only", which usually means that the project is a literature review and does not contain a component of original work.</p>

<p>The marks for "review only" projects are <strong>not</strong> capped, and a very good review (for example, synthesizing a subject area which has not yet been reviewed in the literature) should attract the same credit as any other good report.</p>
{% endif -%}

<p>The submitted report (or a link to download it) is attached to this email. After following the link, your download will begin immediately if you are logged in to <a href="https://mpsprojects.sussex.ac.uk">mpsprojects.sussex.ac.uk</a>. If not, you will be redirected to a login page and the download will begin automatically once you log in.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can download the report from your dashboard at <a href="https://mpsprojects.sussex.ac.uk">mpsprojects.sussex.ac.uk</a>. The convenor has requested that marking and feedback be completed by midnight on {{ deadline.strftime("%a %d %b %Y") }}.</p>

<p>The marking materials (see manifest below) include a similarity report. Please be aware that the report is intended to help you to establish if there is a concern regarding academic misconduct that needs to be investigated. A concern regarding academic misconduct should be raised based on your academic judgement and not on the similarity score alone. Please refer to the FAQs for markers <a href="http://www.sussex.ac.uk/adqe/standards/examsandassessment/esubmission">provided by ADQE</a>.</p>

<p>When you have formed your opinion of the report, please complete the attached marksheet. The exam board requires a short justification of the mark you assign in each category. When the sheet is complete you will need to agree a final mark with the second marker. Your mark schemes are different and there is no expectation that your marks will agree, or be related to each other in a simple way. However, if your marks are more than 10% different, you should record a brief rationale for the relative weighting you adopt in order to assist the exam board with their work.</p>

<p>Both supervisor and marker sheets should be returned to the project convenor (<a href="mailto:{{ config.convenor_email }}">{{ config.convenor_email }}</a>), together with the agreed mark and its rationale. Only one copy of this is needed.</p>

<p>Please also enter your feedback for the student online at <a href="https://mpsprojects.sussex.ac.uk">mpsprojects.sussex.ac.uk</a> using the <em>Edit feedback</em> button for this project visible on your dashboard. By capturing your feedback electronically we ensure that it is pushed directly to the student by email.</p>

<p>If you have been assigned further projects to mark, they will be delivered in separate emails to help with identifying the required marking materials via search.</p>

<p>If you have any questions, please direct these to the project convenor: {{ config.convenor_name }} (<a href="mailto::{{ config.convenor_email }}">{{ config.convenor_email }}</a>).
