Dear {{ marker.user.first_name }}

This email is automated. Please do not reply to it directly, because
email to the sending address is not monitored.

You have been assigned as second marker for a {{ pclass.abbreviation }} student
(candidate number {{ student.exam_number }}).

Title: {{ project.name }}
Supervisor: {{ supervisor.user.name }} <{{ supervisor.user.email }}>

{% if project.aims and project.aims|length > 0 -%}
The supervisor has given the following statement of aims,
which you may wish to bear in mind when forming your opinion of the report.

AIMS:
{{ project.aims|wordwrap(79) }}

{% else -%}
The supervisor has not yet given a statement of aims for this project.

{% endif -%}
{% if project.review_only -%}
Please be aware that the project supervisor has marked this project as
"review only", which usually means that the project is a literature review
and does not contain a component of original work.

The marks for "review only" projects are *not* capped, and a very good review
(for example, synthesizing a subject area which has not yet been reviewed
in the literature) should attract the same credit as any other good report.

The submitted report (or a link to download it) is attached to this email.
After following the link, your download will begin immediately if you are
logged in to mpsprojects.sussex.ac.uk. If not, you will be redirected to a
login page and the download will begin automatically once you log in

Alternatively, you can download the report from your dashboard at
https://mpsprojects.sussex.ac.uk. The convenor has requested that marking and
feedback be completed by midnight on {{ deadline.strftime("%a %d %b %Y") }}.

The marking materials (see manifest below) include a similarity report.
Please be aware that the report is intended to help you to establish if
there is a concern regarding academic misconduct that needs to be investigated.
A concern regarding academic misconduct should be raised based on your academic
judgement and not on the similarity score alone. Please refer to the FAQs for
markers provided at:
http://www.sussex.ac.uk/adqe/standards/examsandassessment/esubmission

When you have formed your opinion of the report, please complete
the attached marksheet. The exam board requires a short justification of
the mark you assign in each category. When the sheet is complete you will
need to agree a final mark with the second marker. Your mark schemes are
different and there is no expectation that your marks will agree, or be
related to each other in a simple way. However, if your marks are more
than 10% different, you should record a brief rationale for the relative
weighting you adopt in order to assist the exam board with their work.

Both supervisor and marker sheets should be returned to the project
convenor ({{ config.convenor_email }}), together with the agreed
mark and its rationale. Only one copy of this is needed.

Please also enter your feedback for the student online at
https://mpsprojects.sussex.ac.uk using the 'Edit feedback' button for this
project visible on your dashboard. By capturing your feedback electronically
we ensure that it is pushed directly to the student by email.

If you have been assigned further projects to mark, they will be delivered
in separate emails to help with identifying the required marking materials
via search.

If you have any questions, please direct these to the project convenor:
{{ config.convenor_name }} <{{ config.convenor_email }}>
