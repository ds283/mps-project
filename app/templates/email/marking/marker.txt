Dear {{ role.user.first_name }}

This email is automated. Please do not reply to it directly, because
email to the sending address is not monitored.

You have been assigned as an examiner for a {{ pclass.abbreviation }} student
(candidate number {{ student.exam_number }}).

Title: {{ project.name }} {% if not project.generic and project.owner is not none and project.owner.id != role.user_id %}(project owner: {{ project.owner.user.name }}){% endif %}
{% if supervisors|length > 0 -%}
Supervision team members:
{% for role in supervisors -%}
- {{ role.user.name }} <{{ role.user.email }}>
{% endfor -%}
{%- else -%}
Supervision team: no supervisors have yet been assigned
{%- endif -%}
{%- if markers|length > 0 -%}
Other assigned examiners:
{% for role in markers -%}

{% endfor -%}
{%- endif %}

{% if project.aims and project.aims|length > 0 -%}
The project owner has supplied the following statement of aims,
which you may wish to bear in mind when forming your opinion of the report.

AIMS:
{{ project.aims|wordwrap(79) }}

{% else -%}
The project owner has not yet supplied a statement of aims for this project.

{% endif -%}
{% if project.review_only -%}
This project has been marked as "review only". Please be aware that
the marks for such projects are *not* capped, and a very good review
(for example, synthesizing a subject area which has not yet been reviewed
in the literature) should attract the same credit as any other good report.

{% endif -%}
The submitted report is attached to this email, unless it is too large.
In this case, you can download it using the provided link. After following
the link, your download will begin immediately if you are logged in to
mpsprojects.sussex.ac.uk. If not, you will be redirected to a login page
and the download will begin automatically once you log in.

The convenor has requested that marking and feedback be completed by mid-day
on {{ deadline.strftime("%a %d %b %Y") }}.

A bundle of marking materials is attached (see manifest below).
Your assessment of the project should be based only on the submitted report.

{% if role.external_marking_url and role.external_marking_url|length > 0 -%}
Please record your assessments using this online form:

  {{ role.external_marking_url|safe }}

The form requests a short justification of the mark you assign.
Please also enter feedback for the student.

{% endif -%}
If the marks returned by other examiners (if any) or assigned supervision
staff differ significantly, you may be asked to arrive at an agreed mark.
If this happens you will be contacted by email.

If you have been assigned further projects to mark, they will be delivered in
separate emails.

If you have any questions, please direct these to the project convenor:
{{ config.convenor_name }} <{{ config.convenor_email }}>
