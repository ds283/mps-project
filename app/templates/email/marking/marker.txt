Dear {{ marker.user.first_name }}

You have been assigned as examiner for a {{ pclass.abbrevation }} student
(candidate number {{ student.user.exam_number }}).

Title: {{ project.name }}
Supervisor: {{ supervisor.user.first_name }}

{% if project.aims and project.aims|length > 0 -%}
For this project, the supervisor has given the following statement of aims,
which you may wish to bear in mind when forming your opinion of the report.

AIMS:
{{ project.aims|wordwrap(79) }}

{% else -%}
The supervisor has not yet given a statement of aims for this project.

{% endif -%}
{% if project.review_only -%}
You may also wish to be aware that the project supervisor has marked
this project as "review only", which usually means that the project
is a literature review and does not contain a component of original
work.

The marks for "review only" projects are *not* capped, and a very good
review (for example, synthesizing a subject area which has not yet
been reviewed in the literature) should attract the same credit as any
other good report.

The submitted report is attached to this email. Alternatively, you can
download the report from your dashboard on https://mpsprojects.co.uk.
The convenor has requested that marking and feedback be completed by
{{ record.period.feedback_deadline.strftime("%a %d %b %Y") }}.

When you have formed your opinion of the report, please complete
the attached marksheet and return it to the project convenor.
Please also enter your feedback for the student online at
https://mpsporojects.co.uk: by capturing your feedback electronically
we can ensure that it is pushed to the student by email.

If you have any questions, please direct these to the project convenor:
