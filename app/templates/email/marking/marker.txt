Dear {{ marker.user.first_name }}

This email is automated. Please do not reply to it directly, because
email to the sending address is not monitored.

You have been assigned as second marker for a {{ pclass.abbreviation }} student
(candidate number {{ student.exam_number }}).

Title: {{ project.name }}
Supervisor: {{ supervisor.user.name }} <{{ supervisor.user.email }}>

Note that the project title may well be different from the title of the
submitted report.

{% if project.aims and project.aims|length > 0 -%}
The supervisor has given the following statement of aims,
which you may wish to bear in mind when forming your opinion of the report.

AIMS:
{{ project.aims|wordwrap(79) }}

{% else -%}
The supervisor has not yet given a statement of aims for this project.

{% endif -%}
{% if project.review_only -%}
Please be aware that the project supervisor has marked this project as
"review only", which usually means that the project is a literature review
and does not contain a component of original work.

The marks for "review only" projects are *not* capped, and a very good review
(for example, synthesizing a subject area which has not yet been reviewed
in the literature) should attract the same credit as any other good report.

The download will begin immediately if you are logged in to
