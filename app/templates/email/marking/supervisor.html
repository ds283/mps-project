<p>Dear {{ supervisor.user.first_name }}</p>

<p><strong>This email is automated. Please do not reply to it directly, because email to the sending address is not monitored.</strong></p>

<p>Please find attached the marking materials for your {{ pclass.abbreviation }} student {{ student.user.first_name }} {{ student.user.last_name }} (candidate number {{ student.exam_number }}). You will need to enter the candidate number into the online marking form.</p>

{% if marker -%}
<br>Marker: {{ marker.user.name }} <{{ marker.user.email }}>
{%- else -%}
<br>Marker: no marker has yet been assigned
{%- endif %}
</p>

<p>Note that the project title may well be different from the title of the submitted report.</p>

{% if project.aims is none or (project.aims is not none and project.aims|length == 0) -%}
<p><strong>Note: You have not yet specified aims for this project. Please consider doing so, since an explicit statement of aims can assist the examiner considerably when marking the project report.</strong></p>
{% endif -%}

{% if project.review_only -%}
<p>You have marked this project as "review only". Please be aware that the marks for such projects are <strong>not</strong> capped, and a very good review (for example, synthesizing a subject area which has not yet
been reviewed in the literature) should attract the same credit as any other good report.</p>
{% endif -%}

<p>Please download the report using the link at the bottom of this email. The download will begin immediately if you are logged in to <a href="https://mpsprojects.sussex.ac.uk">mpsprojects.sussex.ac.uk</a>. If not, you will be redirected to a login page and the download will begin automatically once you log in.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can download the report from your dashboard at <a href="https://mpsprojects.sussex.ac.uk">mpsprojects.sussex.ac.uk</a>. The convenor has requested that marking and feedback be completed by noon on {{ deadline.strftime("%a %d %b %Y") }}.</p>

<p>When you have formed your opinion of the report, please complete the online marking form at <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeGXjs0_TA9cuXcZmzsWE4TCJpB73qnov9x5MAY7ziZie9-CQ/viewform">this URL</a>. Full instructions and further guidance are included in the form.</p>

<p>If you have been assigned further projects to mark, they will be delivered in separate emails to help with identifying the required marking materials via search.</p>

<p>If you have any questions, please direct these to the project convenor: {{ config.convenor_name }} (<a href="mailto::{{ config.convenor_email }}">{{ config.convenor_email }}</a>).
