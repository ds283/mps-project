<p>Dear {{ role.user.first_name }}</p>

<p><strong>This email is automated. Please do not reply to it directly, because email to the sending address is not monitored.</strong></p>

<p>Please find attached the marking materials for your {{ pclass.abbreviation }} student {{ student.user.first_name }} {{ student.user.last_name }} (candidate number {{ student.exam_number }}). You should ensure that only the candidate number is used to identify this project if discussing an agreed mark with an examiner.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: You are the owner of this project, but you have not yet specified aims for it. These set out the goals expected to be achieved by a typical student. Please consider doing so, since an explicit statement of aims can assist examiners considerably when marking the project report.</p>
{% endif -%}

{% if project.review_only -%}
<p>This project has been marked as "review only". Please be aware that the marks for such projects are <strong>not</strong> capped, and a very good review (for example, synthesizing a subject area which has not yet  been reviewed in the literature) should attract the same credit as any other good report.</p>

<p>The submitted report is attached to this email, unless it is too large. In this case, you can download it using the provided link. After following the link your download will begin immediately if you are logged in to <a href="https://mpsprojects.sussex.ac.uk">mpsprojects.sussex.ac.uk</a>. If not, you will be redirected to a login page and the download will begin automatically once you log in.</p>

<p>The convenor has requested that marking and feedback be completed by mid-day on {{ deadline.strftime("%a %d %b %Y") }}.</p>

<p>A bundle of marking materials is attached (see manifest below). This may include a similarity report prepared by Turnitin. These reports are provided for information only, and you do not need to take any special action regarding it. You may wish to use it to inform your opinion of whether there are any concerns regarding academic misconduct. Concerns relating to such misconduct should be raised based on your academic judgement and not on the similarity score alone. The similarity report is not provided to the project examiners.</p>

<p>Your assessment of the project can be based on the submitted report, but also continuous assessment over the entire project period.</p>

{% if role.external_marking_url and role.external_marking_url|length > 0 -%}
<p>Please record your assessments using <a href="{{ role.external_marking_url|safe }}">this online form</a>.</p>

<ul><li><a href="{{ role.external_marking_url|safe }}">{{ role.external_marking_url|safe }}</a></li></ul>

<p>The form requests a short justification of the mark you assign in each category. Please also enter feedback for the student.</p>
{%- endif %}

<p>If the marks returned by examiners or other assigned supervision staff (if any) differ significantly, you may be asked to arrive at an agreed mark. If this happens you will be contacted by email.</p>

<p>If you have been assigned further projects to mark, they will be delivered in separate emails.</p>

<p>If you have any questions, please direct these to the project convenor: {{ config.convenor_name }} (<a href="mailto::{{ config.convenor_email }}">{{ config.convenor_email }}</a>).
