<p>Dear {{ supervisor.user.first_name }}</p>

<p><strong>This email is automated. Please do not reply to it directly, because email to the sending address is not monitored.</strong></p>

<p>Please find attached the marking materials for your {{ pclass.abbreviation }} student {{ student.user.first_name }} {{ student.user.last_name }} (candidate number {{ student.exam_number }}). You should ensure that only the candidate number is used to identify this project when discussing an agreed mark with the second marker.</p>

<p>Title: {{ project.name }}
{% if marker -%}
<br></br>Marker: {{ marker.user.name }} <{{ marker.user.email }}>
{%- else -%}
<br>Marker: no marker has yet been assigned
{%- endif %}
</p>

{% if project.aims is none or (project.aims is not none and project.aims|length == 0) -%}
<p><strong>Note</strong>: You have not yet specified aims for this project. Please consider doing so, since an explicit statement of aims can assist the examiner considerably when marking the project report.</p>
{% endif -%}

{% if project.review_only -%}
<p>You have marked this project as "review only". Please be aware that the marks for such projects are <strong>not</strong> capped, and a very good review (for example, synthesizing a subject area which has not yet
been reviewed in the literature) should attract the same credit as any other good report.</p>
{% endif -%}

<p>The submitted report (or a link to download it) is attached to this email. If a link is provided then after following it your download will begin immediately if you are logged in to <a href="https://mpsprojects.sussex.ac.uk">mpsprojects.sussex.ac.uk</a>. If not, you will be redirected to a login page. The download will begin automatically once you log in successfully. Alternatively, you can download the report from your dashboard at <a href="https://mpsprojects.sussex.ac.uk">mpsprojects.sussex.ac.uk</a>. The convenor has requested that marking and feedback be completed by midnight on {{ deadline.strftime("%a %d %b %Y") }}.</p>


<p>The marking materials (see manifest below) include a similarity report. Please be aware that the report is intended to help you to establish if there is a concern regarding academic misconduct that needs to be investigated. A concern regarding academic misconduct should be raised based on your academic judgement and not on the similarity score along. Please refer to the FAQs for markers <a href="http://www.sussex.ac.uk/adqe/standards/examsandassessment/esubmission">provided by ADQE</a>.</p>

<p>When you have formed your opinion of the report, please complete the attached marksheet. The exam board requires a short justification of the mark you assign in each category. When the sheet is complete you will need to agree a final mark with the second marker. Your mark schemes are different and there is no expectation that your marks will agree, or be related to each other in a simple way. However, if your marks are more than 10% different, you should record a brief rationale for the relative weighting you adopt in order to assist the exam board with their work.</p>

<p>Both supervisor and marker sheets should be returned to the project convenor (<a href="mailto:{{ config.convenor_email }}">{{ config.convenor_email }}</a>), together with the agreed mark and its rationale. Only one copy of this is needed.</p>

<p>Please also enter your feedback for the student online at <a href="https://mpsprojects.sussex.ac.uk">mpsprojects.sussex.ac.uk</a> using the <em>Edit feedback</em> button for this project visible on your dashboard. By capturing your feedback electronically we ensure that it is pushed directly to the student by email.</p>

<p>If you have been assigned further projects to mark, they will be delivered in separate emails to help with identifying the required marking materials via search.</p>

<p>If you have any questions, please direct these to the project convenor: {{ config.convenor_name }} <a href="mailto::{{ config.convenor_email }}">{{ config.convenor_email }}</a>.
