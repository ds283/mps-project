Dear {{ supervisor.user.first_name }}

Please find attached the marking materials for your {{ pclass.abbreviation }} student
{{ student.user.first_name }} {{ student.user.last_name }} (candidate number {{ student.exam_number }}). You should ensure
that only the candidate number is used to identify this project when
discussing an agreed mark with the second marker.

Title: {{ project.name }}
{% if marker -%}
Marker: {{ marker.user.name }} <{{ marker.user.email }}>
{%- else -%}
Marker: no marker has yet been assigned
{%- endif %}

{% if project.aims is none or (project.aims is not none and project.aims|length == 0) -%}
Note: You have not yet specified aims for this project. Please consider
doing so, since an explicit statement of aims can assist the examiner
considerably when marking the project report.

{% endif -%}
{% if project.review_only -%}
You have marked this project as "review only". Please be aware that
the marks for such projects are *not* capped, and a very good
review (for example, synthesizing a subject area which has not yet
been reviewed in the literature) should attract the same credit as any
other good report.

{% endif -%}
The submitted report (or a link to download it) is attached to this email.
If a link is provided then your download will begin immediately if you are
logged in the mpsprojects.co.uk. If not, you will be redirected to a login
page. The download will begin automatically once you log in successfully.
Alternatively, you can download the report from your dashboard on
https://mpsprojects.co.uk. The convenor has requested that marking and
feedback be completed by midnight on {{ deadline.strftime("%a %d %b %Y") }}.

When you have formed your opinion of the report, please complete
the attached marksheet. Please do not forget that the exam board requires
a short justification of the mark you assign in each category.
When the sheet is complete you will need to agree a final mark with
the second marker. This can be done by email, or in person if you prefer.
Your mark schemes are different and there is no expectation that your
marks will agree, or be simply related to each other. However, if your
marks are more than 10% different, you should record a brief rationale
for the relative weighting you adopt in order to assist the exam board
with their work.

Both supervisor and marker sheets should be returned to the project
convenor ({{ config.convenor_email }}), together with the agreed
mark and its rationale. (Only one copy of this is needed.)

Please also enter your feedback for the student online at
https://mpsprojects.co.uk using the 'Edit feedback' button for this
project visible on your dashboard. By capturing your feedback electronically
we ensure that it is pushed directly to the student by email.

If you have been assigned further projects to mark, they will be delivered
in separate emails to help with identifying the required marking materials
via search.

If you have any questions, please direct these to the project convenor:
{{ config.convenor_name }} <{{ config.convenor_email }}>

This email is automated. Please do not reply to it directly, because
email to the sending address is not monitored.
