Dear {{ supervisor.user.first_name }}

Please find attached the marking materials for your {{ pclass.abbreviation }} student
{{ student.user.first_name }} {{ student.user.last_name }}.

Title: {{ project.name }}

{% if project.aims is none or (project.aims is not none and project.aims|length == 0) -%}
You have not yet specified aims for this project. Please consider doing so,
since an explicit statement of aims can assist the examiner considerably
when marking the project report.

{% endif -%}
{% if project.review_only -%}
You have marked this project is as "review only". Please be aware that
the marks for such projects are *not* capped, and a very good
review (for example, synthesizing a subject area which has not yet
been reviewed in the literature) should attract the same credit as any
other good report.

{% endif -%}
The submitted report is attached to this email. Alternatively, you can
download the report from your dashboard on https://mpsprojects.co.uk.
The convenor has requested that marking and feedback be completed by

When you have formed your opinion of the report, please complete
the attached marksheet and return it to the project convenor.
Please also enter your feedback for the student online at
https://mpsporojects.co.uk: by capturing your feedback electronically
we can ensure that it is pushed to the student by email.
