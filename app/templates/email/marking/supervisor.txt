Dear {{ supervisor.user.first_name }}

This email is automated. Please do not reply to it directly, because
email to the sending address is not monitored.

Please find attached the marking materials for your {{ pclass.abbreviation }} student
{{ student.user.first_name }} {{ student.user.last_name }} (candidate number {{ student.exam_number }}).
You will need to enter the candidate number into the online marking form.

Title: {{ project.name }}
{% if marker -%}
Marker: {{ marker.user.name }} <{{ marker.user.email }}>
{%- else -%}
Marker: no marker has yet been assigned
{%- endif %}

Note that the project title may well be different from the title of the
submitted report.

{% if project.aims is none or (project.aims is not none and project.aims|length == 0) -%}
Note: You have not yet specified aims for this project. Please consider
doing so, since an explicit statement of aims can assist the examiner
considerably when marking the project report.

{% endif -%}
{% if project.review_only -%}
You have marked this project as "review only". Please be aware that
the marks for such projects are *not* capped, and a very good review
(for example, synthesizing a subject area which has not yet been reviewed
in the literature) should attract the same credit as any other good report.

{% endif -%}
Please download the report using the link at the bottom of this email.
The download will begin immediately if you are logged in to
mpsprojects.sussex.ac.uk. If not, you will be redirected to a login page
and the download will begin automatically once you log in.

Alternatively, you can download the report from your dashboard at
https://mpsprojects.sussex.ac.uk. The convenor has requested that marking and
feedback be completed by noon on {{ deadline.strftime("%a %d %b %Y") }}.

marking form at:

Full instructions and further guidance are included in the form.

If you have been assigned further projects to mark, they will be delivered
in separate emails to help with identifying the required marking materials
