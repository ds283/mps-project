Dear {{ user.first_name }}

Thank you for your efforts in preparing project descriptions and accommodating
student meetings over the last term. We now have a draft of the student
project allocation for next academic year, {{ attempt.year+1 }}-{{ attempt.year+2 }}.
At the moment this draft allocation covers FYP-MPhys, MPP and RP projects.
{% for key in matches %}
{%- set match_list = matches[key] -%}
{%- set config = match_list[0].selector.config %}
-- {{ config.name }}
convenor {{ config.convenor_name }} <{{ config.convenor_email }}>
{% for item in match_list %}
{% if config.project_class.submissions > 1 -%}
{%- set period = config.project_class.get_period(item.submission_period) -%}
{%- set text = period.display_name(config.year+1) + ': ' + item.selector.student.user.name + ' <' + item.selector.student.user.email + '> (' + item.project.name + ')' -%}
{%- else -%}
{%- set text = item.selector.student.user.name + ' <' + item.selector.student.user.email + '> (' + item.project.name + ')' -%}
{%- endif -%}
{{ text|wordwrap(79) }}
{%- endfor %}
{% endfor %}
If you anticipate any problems with this allocation, please let the
appropriate project convenor know as soon as possible.

Not all students have yet been allocated to projects. In particular,
the allocation for BSc project students is likely to be done later in the
year, after we know which students have decided to transfer into the BSc
progamme, and those who were moved or withdrawn by the summer PAB.

If you are participating in FYP-BSc supervision and you currently have a
low allocation, then it is possible that we may have to ask you take one
or more students as part of these later matching rounds. This year we
estimate the typical faculty load will be roughly two students per
faculty supervisor.

Best wishes,
{% for convenor in convenors -%}
{{ convenor.user.first_name }} {{ convenor.user.last_name }}
{% endfor -%}
{%- set pl = 's' -%}
{%- if convenors|length == 1 -%}{%- set pl = '' -%}{%- endif -%}
