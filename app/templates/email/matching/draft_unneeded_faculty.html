<p>Dear {{ user.first_name }}</p>

<p><strong>This email is sent from an automated address. Please don't reply to it directly, because your email won't reach us.</strong></p>

<p>Thank you for your efforts in preparing project descriptions and accommodating student meetings over the last term. We now have a draft of the student project allocation for next academic year, {{ attempt.submit_year_a }}-{{ attempt.submit_year_b }}.</p>

<p>At this stage you have not been allocated any projects to supervise next year. However, as usual, a small number of students have not yet been allocated projects. These situations will hopefully resolve shortly, and as part of this process we may contact you to discuss the possibility of supervising a student. Please bear with us as we work through these cases.</p>

<p>Best wishes<br>
the project convenors
