Dear {{ user.first_name }}

Thank you for your efforts in preparing project descriptions and accommodating
student meetings over the last term. We now have a draft of the student
project allocation for next academic year, {{ attempt.year+1 }}-{{ attempt.year+2 }}.

At this stage you have not been allocated any projects to supervise next year.
However, not all students have yet been allocated to projects because the
necessary information is unavailable. This includes students who decide to transfer
from MPhys to BSc, together with any students who are moved or withdrawn by the PAB.

A final, definitive list of students who require supervisors may not be available
until early September. At that point, or earlier, we may contact you to discuss
supervising students as they become known to us. Thanks very much for your
patience during this process.

Best wishes,
the project convenors
