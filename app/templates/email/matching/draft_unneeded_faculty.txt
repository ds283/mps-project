Dear {{ user.first_name }}

Thank you for your efforts in preparing project descriptions and accommodating
student meetings over the last term. We now have a draft of the student
project allocation for next academic year, {{ attempt.year+1 }}-{{ attempt.year+2 }}.
At the moment this draft allocation covers FYP-MPhys, MPP and RP projects.

At this stage you have not been allocated any projects to supervise next year.
However, not all students have yet been allocated to projects. In particular,
the allocation for FYP-BSc project students is likely to be done later in the
year, after we know which students have decided to transfer into the BSc
programme, and those who were moved or withdrawn by the summer PAB.

Since you have not yet been allocated any students, if you are participating
in FYP-BSc supervision then it is probable that we will need to ask you take
one or more students as part of these later matching rounds. This year we
estimate the typical faculty load will be roughly two students per faculty
supervisor.

Best wishes,
the project convenors
