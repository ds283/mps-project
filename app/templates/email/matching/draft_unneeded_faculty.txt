Dear {{ user.first_name }}

This email is sent from an automated address. Please don't reply to
it directly, because your email won't reach us.

Thank you for your efforts in preparing project descriptions and accommodating
student meetings over the last semester. We now have a draft of the student
project allocation.

This notification includes information only about the following project types:
{%- for config in attempt.config_members %}
 - {{ config.project_class.name }}
{%- endfor %}
If you are involved in supervising other types of project, these will be advised separately.

At this stage you have not been allocated any projects to supervise next year.
However, as usual, a small number of students have not yet been allocated
projects because their progression outcomes will not become known until
after the A3 PAB.

These situations will hopefully be resolved shortly, and as part of this
process we may contact you to discuss the possibility of supervising a
student. Please bear with us as we work through these cases.

Best wishes,
the project convenors
