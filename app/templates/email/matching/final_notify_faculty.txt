Dear {{ user.first_name }}

This email is sent from an automated address. Please don't reply to it
directly, because your email won't reach us.

Thank you for your efforts in preparing project descriptions and accommodating
student meetings over the last semester. We are now able to advise you of the
students that you have been allocated.

You may already have been advised of a draft allocation. This email is
confirmation of the final allocation, but it should not be different unless
changes have been discussed with you beforehand.

This notification includes information only about the following project types:
{% for config in attempt.config_members %}
 - {{ config.project_class.name }}
{%- endfor %}
If you are involved in supervising other types of project, these will be advised separately.

The students we are asking you to supervise are:
{% for key in matches %}
{%- set match_list = matches[key] -%}
{%- set config = match_list[0].selector.config %}
** {{ config.name }} **
convenor {{ config.convenor_simple_name }} <{{ config.convenor_email }}>
{% for item in match_list %}
{% if config.project_class.number_submissions > 1 -%}
{%- set period = config.project_class.get_period(item.submission_period) -%}
{%- set text = period.display_name(config.select_year_a) + ': ' + item.selector.student.user.name + ' <' + item.selector.student.user.email + '> (' + item.project.name + ')' -%}
{%- else -%}
{%- set text = item.selector.student.user.name + ' <' + item.selector.student.user.email + '> (' + item.project.name + ')' -%}
{%- endif -%}
{{ text|wordwrap(79) }}
{%- endfor %}
{% endfor %}
If you anticipate any problems with this allocation, please let the
appropriate project convenor know as soon as possible.

Best wishes,
{% for convenor in convenors -%}
{{ convenor.user.first_name }} {{ convenor.user.last_name }}
{% endfor -%}
{%- set pl = 's' -%}
{%- if convenors|length == 1 -%}{%- set pl = '' -%}{%- endif -%}
(the projects convenor{{ pl }})
