Dear {{ user.first_name }}

This email is sent from an automated address. Please don't reply to
it directly, because your email won't reach us.

Thank you for your efforts in preparing project descriptions and accommodating
student meetings in the last academic year. You may have received notification
of a draft matching in July, which included MPhys final-year projects only.
We now have an updated project allocation that includes BSc final-year
projects and Mathematical Physics Projects. The students we are asking you to
supervise this year are:
{% for key in matches %}
{%- set match_list = matches[key] -%}
{%- set config = match_list[0].selector.config %}
-- {{ config.name }}
convenor {{ config.convenor_name }} <{{ config.convenor_email }}>
{% for item in match_list %}
{% if config.project_class.submissions > 1 -%}
{%- set period = config.project_class.get_period(item.submission_period) -%}
{%- set text = period.display_name(config.year+1) + ': ' + item.selector.student.user.name + ' <' + item.selector.student.user.email + '> (' + item.project.name + ')' -%}
{%- else -%}
{%- set text = item.selector.student.user.name + ' <' + item.selector.student.user.email + '> (' + item.project.name + ')' -%}
{%- endif -%}
{{ text|wordwrap(79) }}
{%- endfor %}
{% endfor %}
If you anticipate any problems with this allocation, please let the
appropriate project convenor know as soon as possible.

For a small number of BSc students it was not possible to allocate projects
until their progression outcomes were known. If you are not already being
asked to supervise three students, it is possible that one or more
additional students will be assigned to you over the coming days.

Best wishes,
{% for convenor in convenors -%}
{{ convenor.user.first_name }} {{ convenor.user.last_name }}
{% endfor -%}
{%- set pl = 's' -%}
{%- if convenors|length == 1 -%}{%- set pl = '' -%}{%- endif -%}
(the projects convenor{{ pl }})
