Dear {{ user.first_name }}

Thank you for your efforts in preparing project descriptions and accommodating
student meetings over the last term.  The final project allocation is now
available. Unless you have already been contacted to discuss changes, there
should be no variation compared to the draft allocation of which you have
already been notified.

{% for key in matches -%}
{%- set match_list = matches[key] -%}
{%- set config = match_list[0].selector.config -%}
-- {{ config.name }}
convenor {{ config.convenor_name }} <{{ config.convenor_email }}>

{% for item in match_list %}
Period {{ item.submission_period }}: {{ item.selector.student.name }} ({{ item.project.name }})
{% endfor %}
{%- endfor %}

If you anticipate any problems with this allocation, please let the
appropriate project convenor know as soon as possible.

Best wishes,
{% for convenor in convenors -%}
{{ convenor.user.first_name }} {{ convenor.user.last_name }}
{% endfor -%}
(the project convenors)
