<p>Dear {{ user.first_name }}</p>

<p>This email is sent from an automated address. Please don't reply to it directly, because your email won't reach us.</p>

<p>Thank you for your efforts in preparing project descriptions and accommodating student meetings over the last term. The final project allocation is now available, and the good news is that we have not needed to allocate you any projects to supervise next year.</p>

<p>As usual, for a small number of BSc students it is not possible to allocate projects until their progression outcomes are known. As this situation becomes clearer, it is possible that we may need to ask you to take one of these students. If that is the case we will be in touch with you individually. Thank you for your patience during this process.</p>

<p>Best wishes<br>
the project convenors
