Dear {{ user.first_name }}

This email is sent from an automated address. Please don't reply to

Thank you for your efforts in preparing project descriptions and accommodating
student meetings over the last term. The final project allocation is now
available, and the good news is that we have not needed to allocate you any
projects to supervise next year.

There is some possibility that the allocation might need to be adjusted over
the first few weeks of term. If that is the case, we will be in touch
with you individually. Thank you for your patience during this process.

Best wishes,
the project convenors
