Dear {{ user.first_name }}

This email is sent from an automated address. Please don't reply to
it directly, because your email won't reach us.

Thank you for your efforts in preparing project descriptions and accommodating
student meetings over the last term. The final project allocation is now
available, and the good news is that we have not needed to allocate you any
projects to supervise next year.

There is a very small possibility that we may need to reshuffle some project
allocations near the start of teaching. Hopefully this will not occur,
but if it does, we will be in touch with you individually where relevant.
Thank you for your patience during this process.

Best wishes,
the project convenors
