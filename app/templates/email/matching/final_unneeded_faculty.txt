Dear {{ user.first_name }}

This email is sent from an automated address. Please don't reply to

Thank you for your efforts in preparing project descriptions and accommodating
student meetings over the last term. The final project allocation is now
available, and the good news is that we have not needed to allocate you any
projects to supervise next year.

As usual, for a small number of BSc students it is not possible to allocate
projects until their progression outcomes are known. As this situation becomes
clearer, it is possible that we may need to ask you to take one of these
students. If that is the case we will be in touch with you individually.
Thank you for your patience during this process.

Best wishes,
the project convenors
