Dear {{ user.name }}

This is an automated email from the Sussex Physics & Astronomy
project management web app at https://mpsprojects.co.uk.

{% if notifications|length > 0 -%}
The following events have occurred since your last summary email:

{% for notify in notifications -%}
- {{ notify|string|wordwrap(75) }}

{% endfor -%}
{%- endif -%}

{% if outstanding|length > 0 -%}
The following confirmation requests still require a response. It would
be appreciated if they could be dealt with at your earliest convenience:

{% for req in outstanding -%}
{%- set line = req.owner.student.user.name + ' for "' + req.project.name + '" (' + req.request_timestamp.strftime("%a %d %b %Y %H:%M:%S") + ')' -%}
- {{ line|wordwrap(75) }}

{% endfor -%}
{%- endif -%}
