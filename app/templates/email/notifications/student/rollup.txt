You have open requests for meeting confirmations. These are required where
a faculty member has requested to meet with all students who are interested
in selecting their project. The purpose of these meetings is to ensure
the project is appropriate for you, and that you have a suitable background
from courses and other projects.

{% for req in outstanding -%}
{%- set line = req.project.owner.user.name + ' for "' + req.project.name + '" (' + req.project.config.project_class.name + ', requested at ' + req.request_timestamp.strftime("%a %d %b %Y %H:%M:%S") + ')' -%}
- {{ line|wordwrap(75) }}

{% endfor -%}
If you have met with a prospective supervisor but are still waiting for
your request to be confirmed, you should politely contact them again by
email. If you are still unsuccessful, please speak to the project convenor.

{% endif -%}

You can adjust your email preferences, including the frequency with which
you will be mailed notifications, in the 'Settings...' section of your
