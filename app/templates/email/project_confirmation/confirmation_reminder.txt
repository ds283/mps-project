Dear {{ user.first_name }}

This is an automated email from the Sussex Physics & Astronomy
project management web app at https://mpsprojects.sussex.ac.uk.
It is sent from an address that is not monitored or answered;
please direct any queries to the project convenor.

You are receiving this email because you are enrolled as a supervisor for
projects of type "{{ pclass.name }}". If you believe this to be
incorrect, please contact the project convenor to have your enrollment
status changed.

We would like to gently remind you that the deadline to check or modify
your project descriptions for "{{ pclass.name }}" is getting close.
{% if config.request_deadline is defined and config.request_deadline is not none -%}
The current deadline is {{ config.request_deadline.strftime("%a %d %b %Y") }}, and it would be very helpful
if you could confirm your projects before then.
{%- endif %}

To check your projects, please log in to the project management web app
at https://mpsprojects.sussex.ac.uk and select 'My projects/My project
library...' from the drop-down menu in the menubar. Alternatively, the list of
active projects associated with each project type is shown in the appropriate
tab on your dashboard. This shows which projects will be published to
students. If you wish to withdraw a project, use the Action menu shown in the
list and choose 'Don't offer this project'. You can also deactivate the project
entirely from the library view.

{% if number_projects == 0 -%}
Please note that you currently have no projects in your library that are
eligible for this project type. If you wish one or more projects to be
offered to students in this cycle you will need to edit an existing
project, or create a new one.
{%- else -%}
{%- set pl = 's' %}{%- if number_projects == 1 -%}{%- set pl = '' -%}{%- endif -%}
You currently have {{ number_projects }} project{{ pl }} eligible for this project type:
{% for p in projects -%}
- {{ p.name }}
{% endfor %}
{% endif -%}

When you are satisfied that your project descriptions are up-to-date,
return to your dashboard and select the "{{ pclass.name }}" tab.
An information request box labelled "Selections: Confirmation of projects
required" should appear highlighted in red at the top of the page.
You can confirm projects individually, or use the green 'Confirm all projects'
button if everything is ready to go.

If you have already reviewed your projects, please log in again and ensure
you have confirmed them all. This will ensure that you do not
receive further unnecessary reminder emails. Please note that if your
project has variants for different project types then you may need
to confirm them individually from the appropriate tab on your dashboard.

Thank you for your help,
{{ pclass.convenor.user.first_name }} {{ pclass.convenor.user.last_name }} ({{ pclass.convenor.user.email }})
