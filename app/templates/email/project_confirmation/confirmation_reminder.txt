Dear {{ user.first_name }}

This is an automated email from the Sussex Physics & Astronomy
project management web app at https://mpsprojects.co.uk.

You are receiving this email because you are enrolled as a supervisor for
projects of type "{{ pclass.name }}". If you believe this to be
incorrect, please contact the project convenor to have your enrollment
status changed.

We would like to gently remind you that the deadline to check or modify
your project descriptions for "{{ pclass.name }}" is getting close.
{% if config.request_deadline is defined and config.request_deadline is not none -%}
The current deadline is {{ config.request_deadline.strftime("%a %d %b %Y") }}, and it would be very helpful
if you could confirm your projects before then.
{%- endif %}

To check your projects, please log in to the project management web app
at https://mpsprojects.co.uk and select 'My projects/My project library...'
from the drop-down menu in the menubar. All active projects associated
with this project type will be published to the students. If you wish
to withdraw a project from this year's selection, please deactivate the
project using the 'Actions/Make inactive' menu option.

{% if number_projects == 0 -%}
Please note that you currently have no projects in your library that are
eligible for this project type. If you wish one or more projects to be
offered to students in this cycle you will need to edit an existing
project, or create a new one.
{%- else -%}
{%- set pl = 's' %}{%- if number_projects == 1 -%}{%- set pl = '' -%}{%- endif -%}
You currently have {{ number_projects }} project{{ pl }} eligible for this project type:
{% for p in projects -%}
- {{ p.name }}
{%- endfor %}
{%- endif %}

When you are satisfied that your project descriptions are up-to-date,
return to your dashboard and select the "{{ pclass.name }}" tab.
An information request box labelled "Selections: Confirmation of projects
required" should appear highlighted in yellow at the top of the page.
Please click the red 'Confirm' button to indicate that your projects are
ready to go.

If you have already reviewed your projects, please log in again and ensure
you have clicked the 'Confirm' button. This will ensure that you do not
receive further unnecessary reminder emails. Please note that you need to
provide separate confirmation for each project type in which you are
enrolled.

Thank you for your help,
{{ pclass.convenor.user.first_name }} {{ pclass.convenor.user.last_name }} ({{ pclass.convenor.user.email }})
