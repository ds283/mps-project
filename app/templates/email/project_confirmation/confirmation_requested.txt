Dear {{ user.first_name }}

This email is automated. Please do not reply to it directly, because email
to the sending address is not monitored.

You are receiving this message because you are enrolled as a supervisor for
projects of type "{{ pclass.name }}". If you believe this to be
incorrect, please contact the project convenor ({{ pclass.convenor.user.email }}).

We are now preparing to publish project descriptions to this year's
Y{{ pclass.start_level.academic_year-1 }} cohort. To help us, we would like to ask you to confirm the projects
you wish to offer in this cycle.

To check your projects, please log in to the project management web app
at https://mpsprojects.sussex.ac.uk and select 'My projects/My project
library...' from the drop-down menu in the menubar. Alternatively, the list of
active projects associated with each project type is shown in the corresponding
tab on your dashboard. If you wish to withdraw a project, use the Action menu
shown in the list and choose 'Don't offer this project'. If a project has come
to the end of its life, you can deactivate it entirely from the library view.

{% if number_projects == 0 -%}
Please note that you currently have no projects in your library that are
eligible for this project type. If you wish one or more projects to be
offered to students in this cycle you will need to edit an existing
project, or create a new one.
{%- else -%}
{%- set pl = 's' %}{%- if number_projects == 1 -%}{%- set pl = '' -%}{%- endif -%}
You currently have {{ number_projects }} project{{ pl }} eligible for this project type:
{% for p in projects -%}
- {{ p.name }}
{% endfor -%}
{% if number_projects == 1 -%}
If you make no changes, this project will be offered to students in this
cycle.
{%- else -%}
If you make no changes, these projects will be offered to students in this
cycle.
{%- endif %}
{%- endif %}

When you are satisfied that your project descriptions are up-to-date,
please return to your dashboard and select the "{{ pclass.name }}" tab.
An information request box labelled "Selections: Confirmation of projects
required" should appear highlighted in red at the top of the page.
You can confirm projects individually, or use the green 'Confirm all projects'
button if everything is ready to go.

{% if config.request_deadline is defined and config.request_deadline is not none -%}
It would be very helpful if you could provide your response
by {{ config.request_deadline.strftime("%a %d %b %Y") }} at latest.
{%- endif %}

You will receive one copy of this email for each project type in which you
are enrolled as a supervisor. Please note that if your project has variants
for different project types then you may need to confirm them individually
from the appropriate tab on your dashboard.

Thank you for your help,
{{ pclass.convenor.user.first_name }} {{ pclass.convenor.user.last_name }} ({{ pclass.convenor.user.email }})
