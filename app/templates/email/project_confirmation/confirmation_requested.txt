Dear {{ user.first_name }}

This is an automated email from the Sussex Physics & Astronomy
project management web app at https://mpsprojects.co.uk.

You are receiving this email because you are enrolled as a supervisor for
projects of type "{{ pclass.name }}". If you believe this to be
incorrect, please contact the project convenor to have your enrollment
status changed.

The convenor is now preparing to publish project descriptions to this year's
Y{{ pclass.start_level.academic_year-1 }} students, from which they will select a ranked list of preferences.
To help us with this process we would like to ask you to confirm that
the project descriptions in your library are up-to-date.

To check your projects, please log in to the project management web app
at https://mpsprojects.co.uk and select 'My projects/My project library...'
from the drop-down menu in the menubar. All active projects associated
with this project type will be published to the students. If you wish
to withdraw a project from this year's selection, please deactivate the
project using the 'Actions/Make inactive' menu option.

{% if number_projects == 0 -%}
Please note that you currently have no projects in your library that are
eligible for this project type. If you wish one or more projects to be
offered to students in this cycle you will need to edit an existing
project, or create a new one.
{%- else -%}
{%- set pl = 's' %}{%- if number_projects == 1 -%}{%- set pl = '' -%}{%- endif -%}
You currently have {{ number_projects }} project{{ pl }} eligible for this project type:
{% for p in projects -%}
- {{ p.name }}
{% endfor -%}
If you make no changes, these projects will be made available to students
in this cycle.
{%- endif %}

When you are satisfied that your project descriptions are up-to-date,
return to your dashboard and select the "{{ pclass.name }}" tab.
An information request box labelled "Selections: Confirmation of projects
required" should appear highlighted in yellow at the top of the page.
Please click the red 'Confirm' button to indicate that your projects are
ready to go.
{%- if config.request_deadline is defined and config.request_deadline is not none -%}
 It would be very helpful if you could provide your response
by {{ config.request_deadline.strftime("%a %d %b %Y") }} at latest.
{%- endif %}

You will receive one copy of this email for each project type in which you
are enrolled as a supervisor. Please note that you need to provide confirmation
for each project type individually.

This email is sent from an address that is not monitored or answered.
Please direct any queries to the project convenor.

Thank you for your help,
{{ pclass.convenor.user.first_name }} {{ pclass.convenor.user.last_name }} ({{ pclass.convenor.user.email }})
