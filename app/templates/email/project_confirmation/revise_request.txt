Dear {{ user.first_name }}

This is an automated email from the Sussex Physics & Astronomy
project management web app at https://mpsprojects.co.uk.
It is sent from an address that is not monitored or answered;
please direct any queries to the project convenor.

Thank you for responding to the recent request to update your project
descriptions (if required) for the next selection cycle. We have received
your instruction that your project descriptions are ready for publication
in at least one project class.

We appreciate that you are very busy and have limited time for each
task the department asks you to carry out. However, having reviewed the
corresponding projects we would like to ask whether you would consider
looking again at the description:

{{ project.name }}/{{ record.label }}

You can access this from your project library, available here:

https://mpsprojects.co.uk/faculty/edit_projects

This description was confirmed for publication for the following
project types:
{% for pcl in pcl_names -%}
- {{ pcl }}
{%- endfor %}

In most cases the project convenor will have provided a comment with more
detailed information. You can view these comments by opening the live
preview, either by clicking on the project name in the library list or by
choosing 'Preview web page' from the Actions menu. When you are satisfied
that no further changes are needed, please simply re-confirm that your
projects are ready for publication using the 'Confirm' button on the dashboard
panel for each project type.

Thank you for your help,
{{ current_user.first_name }} {{ current_user.last_name }}
