Dear {{ user.first_name }}

Thank you for responding to the recent request to update your project
descriptions (if required) for the next selection cycle. We have received
your instruction that one or more of your project descriptions are ready
for publication.

We appreciate that you are very busy and have limited time for each
task the department asks you to carry out. We would like to ask,
however, whether you would consider looking again at the description for:

{{ project.name }}/{{ record.label }}

Please note that this has nothing to do with the scientific or educational
value of the project. We are only asking for modifications to the project
description, because these may become externally visible at some point in
the future, and we hope that any changes required will take only a few moments
of your time.

You can access the description from your project library, available here:

https://mpsprojects.co.uk/faculty/edit_projects

This description was confirmed for publication for the following
project types:
{% for pcl in pcl_names -%}
- {{ pcl }}
{% endfor %}
In most cases the project convenor will have provided a comment with more
detailed information. You can view these comments by opening the live
preview, either by clicking on the project name in the library list or by
choosing 'Preview web page' from the Actions menu. When you are satisfied
that no further changes are needed, please simply re-confirm that your
projects are ready for publication using the 'Confirm' button on the dashboard
panel for each project type.

Thank you for your help,
{{ current_user.first_name }} {{ current_user.last_name }}
