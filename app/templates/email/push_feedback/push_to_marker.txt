Dear {{ person.first_name }}

This email is automated. Please do not reply to it directly, because mail
to the sending address is not monitored.

Many thanks for your efforts in marking project reports this year. We are
aware there is a large marking burden at a pressured time of the academic
year, and your input is very much appreciated. Final marks are now available
and have been published to students.

Because of the way Canvas works with Turnitin, we cannot post feedback there
directly. Therefore, we are distributing this to students directly by email.

For your records, please find attached the feedback documents for those
students whose reports you examined. If the size or number of attached
files is too large, some of these may be provided as download links.

These documents are for:
- {{ pclass.name }} {{ period.display_name }}

The students included are:
{% for submitter in submitters %}
- {{ submitter.owner.student.user.name }} - {{ submitter.project.name }} {% if not submitter.project.generic and submitter.project.owner is not none %}(owner {{ submitter.project.owner.user.name }}){% endif %}
{% endfor %}

If you have questions, please contact the project convenor using the
address below.
