<p>Dear {{ student.first_name }}</p> (cc supervision team)

<p><strong>This email is automated. Please do not reply to it directly, because mail to the sending address is not
    monitored.</strong></p>

<p>Marks for your project have now been published and are available to you from Sussex Direct. However, your supervision
    team and examiners also provide more detailed feedback. Because of the way Canvas works with Turnitin, we cannot
    post this feedback there, so we are sending it to you directly. Please see the attached PDF document.</p>

<p>This feedback is for:</p>
<ul>
    <li>{{ pclass.name }} {{ period.display_name }}</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have questions, please contact the project convenor using the link below.</p>
