<p>Dear {{ student.first_name }}</p>

<p><strong>This email is automated. Please do not reply to it directly, because mail to the sending address is not
    monitored.</strong></p>

<p>Marks for your project have now been published and are available to you from Sussex Direct. However, your supervision
    team and examiners have also provided more detailed feedback. Because of the way Canvas works with Turnitin, we
    cannot post this feedback there, so we are sending it to you directly. Please see the attached PDF document.</p>

<p>If the size or number of attached files is too large, some of these may be provided as download links.</p>

<p>This feedback is for:</p>
<ul>
    <li>{{ pclass.name }} {{ period.display_name }}</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have questions, please contact the project convenor using the link below.</p>
