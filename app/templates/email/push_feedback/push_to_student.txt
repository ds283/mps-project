Dear {{ student.first_name }} (cc supervision team)

This email is automated. Please do not reply to it directly, because mail
to the sending address is not monitored.

Marks for your project have now been published and are available to you
from Sussex Direct. However, your supervision team and examiners also
provide more detailed feedback. Because of the way Canvas works with
Turnitin, we cannot post this feedback there, so we are sending it
to you directly. Please see the attached PDF document.

This feedback is for:
{{ pclass.name }} {{ period.display_name }}

If you have questions, please contact the project convenor using the
address below.
