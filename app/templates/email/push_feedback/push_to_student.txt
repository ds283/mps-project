Dear {{ student.first_name }}

This email is automated. Please do not reply to it directly, because mail
to the sending address is not monitored.

Marks for your project have now been published and are available to you
from Sussex Direct. However, your supervision team and examiners also
provide more detailed feedback. Because of the way Canvas works with
Turnitin, we cannot post your feedback there, so we are sending it
to you directly via email. Please see the attached PDF document.

If the size or number of attached files is too large, some of these may
be provided as download links.

This feedback is for:
- {{ pclass.name }} {{ period.display_name }}

If you have questions or concerns, please contact the project convenor
using the address below.
