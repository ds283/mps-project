Dear {{ person.first_name }}

This email is automated. Please do not reply to it directly, because mail
to the sending address is not monitored.

Many thanks for your efforts in supervising project students this year,
and providing critical feedback for them. Final marks are now available
and have been published to students.

Because of the way Canvas works with Turnitin, we cannot post feedback for
yourself (and the examiners) there directly. Therefore, we are distributing
this to students directly by email.

For your records, please find attached the feedback documents for your
supervision students. If the size or number of attached files is too large,
some of these may be provided as download links.

These documents are for:
{{ pclass.name }} {{ period.display_name }}

The students included are:
{% for submitter in submitters %}
- {{ submitter.owner.student.user.name }} - {{ submitter.project.name }}
{% endfor -%}

If you have questions, please contact the project convenor using the
address below.
