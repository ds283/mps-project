Dear {{ user.first_name }}

This is an automated email from the Sussex Physics & Astronomy
project management web app at https://mpsprojects.sussex.ac.uk.
It is sent from an address that is not monitored or answered;
please direct any queries to the project convenor.

This is a gentle reminder that a project presentation assessment event is
being scheduled between {{ event.earliest_date }} and {{ event.latest_date }}.
There will be approximately {{ event.number_talks }} students giving presentations based on
projects drawn from the following:
{%- for period in event.available_periods %}
- {{ period.config.project_class.name }} {% if period.config.project_class.submissions > 1 -%}{{ period.display_name }}{%- endif -%}
{%- endfor %}
In order to prepare a timetable we are collecting availability information
from faculty members, but we do not yet appear to have received your details.

To enter your availability, please log in to the project management web app
at https://mpsprojects.sussex.ac.uk. Once you have logged in, the information request
box should appear highlighted in red at the top of your dashboard. It would be
very helpful if you could provide your response by {{ event.availability_deadline.strftime("%a %d %b %Y") }}
at latest.

If you have already entered your details, please log in again and ensure you
have clicked the 'Confirm' button at the bottom of the availability selector.
This will ensure that you do not receive further unnecessary reminder emails.

This presentation event is being organized by {{ event.created_by.first_name }} {{ event.created_by.last_name }} ({{ event.created_by.email }}).
Please direct queries to this address.

Thank you for your help,
