Dear {{ user.first_name }}

Thank you for entering your availability to assess the project presentation event
taking place between {{ event.earliest_date }} and {{ event.latest_date }}.

We now have a draft of the assessment timetable, and we would like to ask you
to cover the following sessions:

{% for slot in slots -%}
{{ slot.date_as_string }} {{ slot.session_type_string }} in {{ slot.room_full_name }} ({{ slot.session_details }})
{% endfor %}
If you anticipate any difficulties with this, please let the event organizer know
as soon as possible: {{ event.created_by.first_name }} {{ event.created_by.last_name }} ({{ event.created_by.email }})

This is an automated email. Please do not reply to it directly, because messages
sent to this mailbox are not monitored or answered. If you have questions or
concerns, please direct these to the event organizer.

Best wishes,
{% for fac in event.convenor_list -%}
{{ fac.user.first_name }} {{ fac.user.last_name }}
{% endfor -%}
(the project convenors)
