Dear {{ user.first_name }}

Thank you for entering your availability to assess the project presentation
event taking place between {{ event.earliest_date }} and {{ event.latest_date }}.

We now have a draft of the assessment timetable. As things stand, we hope not
to have to ask you to assess any sessions in the event. This may change as
other faculty members update their constraints, in which case we will advise
you as soon as possible.

This is an automated email. Please do not reply to it directly, because
messages sent to this mailbox are not monitored or answered. If you have
questions or concerns, please direct these to the event organizer:

{{ event.created_by.first_name }} {{ event.created_by.last_name }} ({{ event.created_by.email }})

Best wishes,
{% for fac in event.convenor_list -%}
{{ fac.user.first_name }} {{ fac.user.last_name }}
