Dear {{ user.first_name }}

You are receiving this email because you are participating in an upcoming
presentation assessment taking place between {{ event.earliest_date }} and
{{ event.latest_date }}.

The final timetable for this event is now available, and the good news is that
we do not need to ask you to assess any sessions in the event.

This is an automated email. Please do not reply to it directly, because
messages sent to this mailbox are not monitored or answered. If you have
questions or concerns, please direct these to the event organizer:

{{ event.created_by.first_name }} {{ event.created_by.last_name }} ({{ event.created_by.email }})

Best wishes,
{% for fac in event.convenor_list -%}
{{ fac.user.first_name }} {{ fac.user.last_name }}
