Dear {{ user.first_name }}

A system administrator has submitted a project selection on your
behalf. This email confirms receipt of these project choices,
which were submitted on {{ sel.submission_time.strftime("%a %d %b %Y %H:%M:%S") }}.

The selection that has been recorded is:
{% for item in sel.ordered_selections -%}
- {{ item.rank }}: {{ item.liveproject.name }} {% if not item.liveproject.generic and item.liveproject.owner is not none -%}({{ item.liveproject.owner.user.last_name }}){%- endif %}
{% endfor %}
You can continue to resubmit selections until the submission deadline.
If you make submissions yourself these will override the choices submitted
by the administrator. After the deadline has passed, the most recently
submitted selection will be taken as your preferred choice.

{% if config.live_deadline -%}
The deadline is currently {{ config.live_deadline.strftime("%a %d %b %Y") }}.
{%- endif %}

This is an automated email. Please do not reply to it directly, because
messages sent to this mailbox are not monitored or answered. If you have
questions or concerns, please direct these to the project convenor or a
system administrator, as appropriate.
