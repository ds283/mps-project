                    To protect ourselves from denial-of-service attacks, and to limit the number of
                    attempts an attacker could have to guess your password by brute-force, we limit
                    the number of times you can access the website. You've been sending a lot of requests
                    recently and the limiting threshold has been reached.

                    If you don't think you were doing anything unusual, contact a system administrator
                    and explain what has happened, or file a report with our issue tracker:

                <p>
                    Otherwise, wait a while and your access to the service
                    will be restored.
